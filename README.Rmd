A demonstration of scraping glassdoor reviews using `rvest`.

```{r}
source("R/scrape.R")

# example urls, we'll go with Apple
tesla_url <- "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tesla-Reviews-E43129"
apple_url <- "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Apple-Reviews-E1138"

# loop through n pages, wrap in try catch in case we fail to parse
out <- lapply(2:3, function(x) {
  tryCatch({
    scrape_reviews(
      url = apple_url,
      page = x
    )
  }, error = function(e) {
    warning("Failed to parse page [", x, "]", call. = FALSE)
    NULL
  })
})

# filter for stuff we successfully extracted
reviews <- bind_rows(Filter(Negate(is.null), out), .id = "page")

reviews %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(review_time = clean_review_datetime(review_time_raw)) %>%
  select(
    page,
    review_time,
    review_time_raw,
    review_title,
    employee_role,
    employee_history,
    employeer_pros,
    employeer_cons,
    employeer_rating
  ) %>% 
  glimpse()
